# Student Placement Prediction

The "Student Placement Prediction" project is a machine learning web application built using Flask. It predicts whether a student is likely to get placed based on their academic performance, including CGPA, IQ, and Profile Score. The application uses a machine learning model to make predictions and provides feedback to users in the form of simple web pages.

## Features

- **User Input**: Users can input their CGPA, IQ, and Profile Score.
- **Prediction**: The machine learning model makes a prediction based on the inputs.
- **Result Pages**: After prediction, users are redirected to one of two pages:
  - **Placed**: If the model predicts the student will be placed.
  - **Not Placed**: If the model predicts the student will not be placed.
  
## Technologies Used

- **Flask**: A lightweight Python web framework used to build the web application.
- **Scikit-learn**: A Python library used for creating and using the machine learning model.
- **Numpy**: A library for handling arrays and numerical operations.
- **Pickle**: A module used to serialize and deserialize the machine learning model.

## Prerequisites

To run the application, you'll need the following:

- Python 3.x or higher
- Internet connection to install dependencies

### Install Dependencies

First, clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/student-placement-prediction.git
cd student-placement-prediction
Then, install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
This will install Flask, Scikit-learn, Numpy, and other necessary dependencies.

Setup
Clone the repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/your-username/student-placement-prediction.git
Download the pre-trained machine learning model (student_placement.pkl) and save it in the project directory, alongside app.py.

Run the Flask application:

bash
Copy
Edit
python app.py
Open a browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:5000/ to use the application.

app.py
This is the main Python file that contains the Flask application. It loads the pre-trained machine learning model, processes user input, and routes users to the appropriate pages based on the prediction.

student_placement.pkl
This file contains the trained machine learning model, which is used to predict whether a student will be placed based on their CGPA, IQ, and Profile Score.

templates/
This directory contains the HTML files for the user interface:

index.html: A form where users can enter their details (CGPA, IQ, Profile Score).
placed.html: A page shown when the student is predicted to be placed.
not_placed.html: A page shown when the student is predicted not to be placed.
requirements.txt
This file lists all the dependencies required to run the application. You can install them by running pip install -r requirements.txt.

How It Works
Home Page: The user navigates to the home page (/), where they are prompted to enter their CGPA, IQ, and Profile Score.
Form Submission: When the user submits the form, the data is sent to the /predict endpoint.
Prediction: The Flask app loads the student_placement.pkl model and passes the user input to the model for prediction.
Result: Based on the model's prediction, the user is redirected to either the placed.html page or the not_placed.html page.
